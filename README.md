# Real-Time-Streaming-Data-Pipeline

In many data centers, different type of servers generate large amount of data (basically events, where ‘event’ in this case is the status of the server in the data center) in real-time.

There is always a need to process these data in real-time and generate insights which will be used by the server/data center monitoring personnel. Also, they have to track these servers’ status regularly and find the resolution in case of issues for better server stability.

Since the incoming data is huge and in real-time, the right architecture with scalable storage and computation is required.
